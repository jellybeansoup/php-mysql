#MySQL Library for the JellyStyle Framework

A MySQL query builder and ORM that is designed to work as part of the [JellyStyle
Framework](https://github.com/jellybeansoup/php-framework). It is designed to be
lightweight and unintrusive, and to allow far simple interactions with the database.

This library is, now and always, a work-in-progress. Using it in production
environments is not recommended at this stage.
